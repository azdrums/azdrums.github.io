1. If you built a MegaDrum module with AVR-CDC or FT232 USB board, both depricated,
   instead of PIC18F2550 and without an LCD and want to set MIDI speed to 38400 hold
   the key “DOWN” pressed while powering the module up and release it after a few seconds.

2. If you messed up MegaDrum settings and it became unresponsive and you want to
   load default settings, hold the key “RIGHT” pressed while powering the module
   up and it will load defaults. You can now make changes to the settings and save them.

3. In the Menu, with 'Quick Access' set to Yes, you can quickly jump to a pad
   you want to make changes to by pressing HiHat pedal down and hitting a pad
   you want to jump to. Also, with 'Quick Access' set to Yes, you can quickly
   load next/previous saved drum map by pressing HiHat pedal while in VU meter
   mode and pressing UP/DOWN keys. You can also extend the UP/DOWN keys to to
   two external switches and use them on a foot pedal to load next/previous
   drum map hands free.

4. To jump to the beginning of the Menu press keys “LEFT” and “UP” simultaneously
   or turn the 'Left/Right' rotary encoder counterclockwise while pressing the
   key 'LEFT'.

5. To jump to the end of the menu press keys “LEFT” and “DOWN” simultaneously or
   turn the 'Left/Right' rotary encoder clockwise while pressing the key 'LEFT'.

6. To enter a bootloader to update firmware (if you have a bootloader programmed
   into your MegaDrum), hold the key “LEFT” pressed while powering the module up.

7. You can change the LCD contrast pressing keys UP/DOWN or rotating the 'Up/Down'
   rotary encoder while in the copyright page of the Menu
