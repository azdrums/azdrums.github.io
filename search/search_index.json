Measured/shown in 1/10th of millisecond. Can be set between 1 and 100 (0.1 - 10ms). When MegaDrum detects a signal above Threshold/Dynamic threshold, it will keep sampling it for MinScan period of time before marking the signal as registered and making it ready to be sent over MIDI next MegaDrum scans (scan time is set by 'Latency') all channels for registered signals. Lowering it will improve Latency (MegaDrum latency is between Latency and and Latency+MinScan) and may worsen level accuracy. Raising it will worsen Latency and may improve level accuracy. Generally for rubber type pads/cymbals setting MinScan to 20 (2ms) is enough for proper signal level detection. For mesh type pads you may need to raise MinScan to 30~50 - the bigger mesh type pads the higher MinScan is required for proper signal level detection..</p>"},{"location":"megadrum/pad-settings/#dualhead-for-headbow-input-or-type-for-rimedge-inputs","title":"DualHead for Head/Bow input or Type for Rim/Edge inputs","text":"<p><pre><code>&lt;Ch04: SnareH  &gt;\nDualHead:   Yes\n</code></pre> For Head/Bow inputs: Can be set to No, Yes or 3Way.
